# Simple-Neural-Network-in-Go

This is a project of a simple fully connected neural network with one hidden layer, so there are only three layers in the neural network. Sigmoid is used as the activation function. You can easily run the code in any suitable editor.

In addition, you can study the mathematics of forward and backward signal propagation in the considered neural network. The program code simply repeats <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderArbuzov/Simple-Neural-Network-in-Go/blob/main/A%20fully%20connected%20feedforward%20neural%20network.pdf">this document</a> step by step. In fact, any artificial neural network is just a mathematical function. So if we wanted to write a neural network from scratch in any programming language, then first we would need to write it in mathematical language.
